# Emotion Recognition 

This project accompanies the EMOCA project. Here we provide training and testing code for: 
- image-based emotion recognition networks 
    - EmoNet 
    - vanilla vision backbones 
- EMOCA-based emotion recognotion 
- emotion recognition based on other methods 


## Installation 
Follow the steps at the root of this repo. If for some reason the environment from there is not valid, create one using a `.yml` file from `envs`. After that you should be able to run the demos. 

## Pre-trained models 
All the provided models have been trained on AffectNet, either from scratch (the image-based backbones) or finetuned based on fixed pretrained face reconstruction nets. 



## Demos 

### Single-image based emotion recognition 

### Video-based emotion recognition 


### Training 
If you want to train your own models, you will need to download the AffectNet dataset from the
